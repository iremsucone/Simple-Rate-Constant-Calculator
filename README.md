# Simple-Rate-Constant-Calculator
Automates the analysis of chemical kinetics by determining the reaction order (zero, first, or second order) based on user-provided time and concentration data. It applies integrated rate law transformations, performs linear regression on each, and selects the best model (highest RÂ² value) to calculate the reaction rate constant k.
